# Capitalists

### Game Description
Learn the rules of the Western world in this safe and realistic environment.

The rules of Capitalism are simple:
1. Take all the valuable resources before anyone else can because you want to win (and who cares if everyone else has nothing to eat?)
2. Take more than you can realistically handle (to the point you've grown so large it is literally impossible to manoeuvre)
3. Competitors (no matter how small) are a threat and must be vanquished

#### Warning
Not all resources are assets (green squares and red squares). Some are liabilities (blue and grey squares). Side effects may include death.
