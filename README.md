##Capitalists

### Game Description
Learn the rules of the modern world in this safe and realistic environment.

The rules of Capitalism are simple:
1. Take all the resources before anyone else can because you want to win (and who cares if everyone else has nothing to eat?)
2. Take more than you can realistically handle (to the point you've grown so large it is literally impossible manoeuvre)
3. Competitors (no matter how small) are a threat and must be vanquished
